        <p class="portfolio-paragraph">While planning a trip to Europe and I was having trouble keeping track of all of information that I were gathering on each of the places I wanted to visit.  I thought that it would be so convenient if I could make a custimizable map where I could store information such as hotel phone numbers and places that we want to see, etc.  Thus my journey to set out and create "Take Me There" began.</p>

          <h2 class="portfolio-header">Journey</h2>
          <p class="portfolio-paragraph">I first began by creating a very simple React template that allowed me the very base functionality of this app.  I needed to be able to input a place name,some details about that place, and then be able to push a button to display it into another div.  Using React's props and state this was actually not too challenging.</p>
          <img class="columns eight offset-by-two border space-bottom space-bottom" src="assets/images/take-me-there-test-1.png" alt=""></img>
          <p class="portfolio-paragraph">My next challenge was to add a bit more functionality to this app by being able to add multiple locations and their details.  I also needed a way to be able to edit these details after they had been saved.  Lastly I wanted to be able to display every location's name so that the user could click and display their desired location and it's information.  It forced me to get really good at passing information between React components.</p>
          <img class="columns eight offset-by-two border space-bottom" src="assets/images/take-me-there-test-2.png" alt=""></img>
          <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Finally I had enough of the logic down to be able to begin incorporating a Google map into the project.  To be able to give Google all of the information that it needed to display a marker on the map I needed a better way than to just have the user type in their requested place name as google needs latitude and longitude to accurately place a marker.  Luckily Google allows access to its geosuggest API which returns suggestions for the user to choose from and returns a nice beautifully packaged object with place name, longitude/latitude and timezone.  I really struggled for a long time with how to be able to have the user click on the marker and have the data that the user had typed in be displayed.  In the end I had just been using the onClick handler incorrectly and once I figured that out (it took days), it was relatively smooth sailing.   </p>

          <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The last piece of logic that I needed to figure out was how to persist my data so that users could log in and have their map which would be editable by only themselves.  I turned to Google's firebase as it is a great fit for React applications.  It essentially stores your data in one big Object which is then editable and persistable and works great with javascript.  This was the first time using this platform and it was definetely a learned curve to understand authentication but I feel such a sense of accomplishment being able to have users log onto their accounts and access their information. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h2 class="portfolio-header">Publish</h2>
          <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Once I had all of the logic down all that was left was to add some clever design to really brand it and make it look professional.  I went onto google earth and took some screen shots of iceland that I thought looked interesting and dramatic.  I then pulled out colors from that as my color pallette for the project.  The teal that is used in the title comes the striking lake in the upper left hand corner for example.  As I was going along and making sure everything was going to work on every device new problems obviously arose.  I also added little details that I think make it look really polished.  As you scroll down the logo and name of the app slide in from the left.  I also was able to pull in the users photo so that they know they are in their account. I am hosting it on github pages which is enough for the moment for just a few users.  If this would become more popular in the future I would obviously get it onto a more private server and hosting application.  Please have a look at the app in action, plan a trip and feel free to send me any feedback you migh have on it. </p>
